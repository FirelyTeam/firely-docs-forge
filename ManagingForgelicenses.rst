Managing Forge licenses
=======================

Your `Simplifier & Forge plan <https://simplifier.net/pricing>`_ comes with a set amount of Forge users. 
When Forge users are associated with these license slots they will be able to use Forge.

.. important::
   The Simplifier Entry plan no longer includes the use of Forge.
   If you are a FHIR trainer explaining Forge and Simplifier, then please `get in contact <https://simplifier.net/contact>`_ for a free trainers license and vouchers for your students.

Current situation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently you cannot assign these license slots to specific Simplifier users yet. 
For now, make sure that your Forge users have edit or admin rights on one of the projects associated to your Simplifier & Forge plan. 
Projects associated with your plan need to be owned by the Simplifier user who also owns the license. 

Still the amount of users who are allowed to use Forge for commercial use is limited by the amount allowed in your license.

Future situation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the future the Simplifier user who owns the license will be able to explicitly assign the Forge commercial use slots to specific Simplifier user accounts.
