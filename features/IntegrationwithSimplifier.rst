Integration with Simplifier
===========================

`Simplifier.net <https://simplifier.net/>`__ is a FHIR specification
development, collaboration and publishing platform. The documentation
for the platform can be found
`here <https://docs.fire.ly/projects/Simplifier/>`__.

Forge can synchronize the project files in your local folder with the
files in your project on Simplifier. The following menu options are
available:

Some options are also available in the start and session panels and in
the project toolbar.

   :scale: 75%

The ``Project`` tab contains a toolbar with additional Simplifier
options.

The following paragraphs describe the options in more detail.

Create a FHIR Project on Simplifer
----------------------------------

When starting a new project, you first have to create a project on
Simplifier. At the moment you can only do that via the Simplifier
website. In Forge you can browse to the Simplifier **Create project**
page using one of the following options:
  
- Click ``Create FHIR Project...`` in the Simplifier menu
- Click ``Create FHIR Project on Simplifier.net...`` in one of the following
  places:

  -  Start panel
  -  Session panel
- Click ``Create...`` in the Simplifier toolbar in the Project tab

Enter you project details on Simplifier and click ``Create``.

Open a FHIR Project from Simplifer
----------------------------------

If you donâ€™t have a local project folder yet then you can open a project
on Simplifier to download all project files to a FHIR project folder on
your computer.

-  Click ``Open FHIR Project...`` in the Simplifier menu
-  Click ``Open FHIR Project from Simplifier.net...`` in one of the
   following places:

   -  Start panel
   -  Session panel

The first time you do this you have to select the parent folder for your
FHIR projects. Forge will remember the parent folder you selected but
you can change it at any time by opening the ``Options`` menu, select ``Settings...`` 
and then ``Folders``.

.. figure:: ../images/SyncParentFolderSelection.png
   :alt: Select FHIR parent folder
   :scale: 75%

Select the parent folder and click ``Select Folder``. A dialog is opened
listing all the available projects on Simplifier you can open. When you
select a different project from the list, the project folder name is
updated automatically. Note that you can still manually change the
project folder name if you want.

.. figure:: ../images/SyncConnect.png
   :alt: Open a project from Simplifier

The project item tooltip displays the project title, description, |URL
Key| URL Key and folder icon information:

-  |Folder is empty| An empty folder icon indicates that the project
   folder does not exist or is empty.
-  |Folder is not empty|
   A full folder icon indicates that the project folder already contains
   files and/or subfolders.
-  |Folder already linked| Project folders that are already linked to
   Simplifier are disabled for selection.

The ``Select parent folder FHIR projects...`` button allows you to
change the parent folder for your FHIR projects.. The ``Filter`` button
hides projects that are not compatible with the FHIR version of Forge.
Turn the filter off to list project for all FHIR versions.

Click ``Open`` to create the project folder and download all project
files from Simplifier.

Open a FHIR Project from Simplifer when you already have a local project folder with files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you select a project folder that already contains resource files and
one or more files do not match up with the files already on Simplifier,
the following dialog will open.

.. figure:: ../images/SyncConnectOptions.png
   :alt: Options when open a project from Simplifier

You have three options to specify what you would like to do:

-  **Take the files from your project folder**

   If a file exists both in your project folder and on Simplifier, then
   your local file will be taken. Files on Simplifier that do not exist
   in your project folder will be deleted the next time you synchronize
   with Simplifier.
-  **Take the files from Simplifier**

   If a file exists both in your project folder and on Simplifier, then
   the Simplifier file will be taken. Files in your project folder that
   do not exist on Simplifier will be deleted.
-  **Let me choose which file changes to keep**

Click ``Advanced view`` to show a list of all conflicting file
changes. When you have selected the option
``Let me choose which files to keep`` you have two choices for each
listed file conflict:

- **Select the file change from your project folder**

  The file from your local project folder will be taken. The file will
  be uploaded to Simplifier the next time you synchronize.
- **Select the file change from Simplfier**

  The file from Simplifier is downloaded and replaces the file in your
  project folder.

.. note:: You can select multiple items to apply your 
   choice with one click.

.. figure:: ../images/SyncConnectOptionsAdvanced.png

Click ``Continue`` to create a backup of your local project folder and
download the relevant project files from Simplifier.

Link to FHIR Project on Simplifer
---------------------------------

If you have opened a project folder but you have not yet setup a link
with an existing Simplifier project, you can do so by clicking
``Link...`` in the Simplifier toolbar or selecting
``Link to FHIR Project...`` from the Simplifier menu.

.. figure:: ../images/SyncLinking.png
   :alt: Linking to project on Simplifier

This will open a dialog listing all the available projects on Simplifier
you can open.

.. figure:: ../images/SyncLink.png
   :alt: Link to project on Simplifier

You cannot change the project folder here because you are linking a
Simplifier project to your current project folder. Select the correct
Simplifier project from the list and click ``Link`` to continue.

Status of project files
-----------------------

When you add new profiles to your project or modify existing profiles,
Forge indicates this in the project list view with yellow status icons.
A pen indicates a modified file and a pen with a plus sign indicates an
added file.

.. figure:: ../images/SyncFileStatus.png
   :alt: Project file status
   :scale: 75%

Forge is watching for changes in your project folder so any
modifications you make outside of Forge will be reflected in the list
view. Note that changes to non-resource files (for example mark-down
files) in your project folder will be included as well when
synchronizing with Simplifier even though Forge does not list them.

Synchronizing project files
---------------------------

By clicking the ``Synchronize...`` button Forge will first download
updated files from Simplifier and then upload updated files from your
folder to Simplifier. You can also download or upload separately by
clicking the drop-down arrow and clicking the desired option. The
``Open...`` button opens a browser to your project on Simplifier.

.. figure:: ../images/SyncToolbarDropdown.png
   :alt: Simplifier synchronize options
   :scale: 75%

When you click a synchronize button a dialog is opened showing you a
summary of what will be synchronized.

.. figure:: ../images/SyncSummaryBasicView.png
   :alt: Summary Basic view

By default, the Basic view is displayed. This view will simply describe
what will happen without details. If you want to see more details you
can switch to the Advanced view by clicking ``Advanced view``.

.. figure:: ../images/SyncSummaryAdvancedView.png
   :alt: Summary Advanced view

You can return to the Basic view by clicking ``Basic view``. Click
``Continue`` to synchronize with Simplifier.

Conflicting file changes
------------------------

It can happen that multiple people make modifications to the same
resource. Forge can detect this but it has limited options to resolve a
conflict. You are not required to resolve conflicts but then these
resources will not be synchronized.

.. figure:: ../images/SyncConflictsBasicView.png
   :alt: Summary conflicts Basic view

To resolve conflicts you have to switch to the Advanced view by
clicking ``Advanced view``. For each listed file conflict you have
three choices:

- **Select the file change from your project folder**

  The file from your local project folder will be uploaded to Simplifier
  and replaces the file on Simplifier.
- **Select the file change from Simplfier**

  The file from Simplifier is downloaded and replaces the file in your
  project folder.
- **Leave unresolved**

  The conflict remains unresolved therefore no file upload or download
  will take place.

.. note:: You can select multiple items to apply your 
   choice with one click.

.. figure:: ../images/SyncConflictsAdvancedView.png

Miscellaneous options
---------------------

The ``Repair link...`` button allows you to repair the link between your
project folder and Simplfiier when somebody has changed the url key for
the project on Simplifier.net.

The ``Remove link...`` button allows you to remove the link between your
project folder and Simplfiier.
