       actions, unless and until Licensee has notified Firely that a

       purportedly unlawful or unauthorized use of the Software or
       Documentation, Firely may take all reasonable measures to stop

   d. The Parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies
      arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any contract shall
      first be submitted to the Foundation for the Settlement of Automation
      Disputes (Stichting Geschillenoplossing Automatisering),
      (http://sgoa.eu/en/ with offices in Heemstede, the Netherlands)
      (SGOA) or its successor, for ICT Mediation. The other Party must
      actively participate in the ICT Mediation, which means attending one
      joint meeting between the mediator(s) and the Parties. Each Party may
      terminate the ICT Mediation procedure at any time following the joint
      meeting. Notwithstanding this Section, either Party may seek
      preliminary relief through arbitral proceedings or in a court of law,
      and may take conservatory measures (e.g., attachment) if necessary.
   
   e. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
      Agreement or any contract, or the breach, termination, enforcement,
      interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of
      the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, which is
      not resolved through mediation, will be referred to and finally
      determined by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of
      SGOA, or its successor. The seat of the arbitration will be
      Heemstede, the Netherlands. The arbitration shall be administered for
      a single arbitrator. The language to be used in the arbitral
      proceeding will be English. Judgment upon the award rendered by the
      arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.
      ANY CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST FIRELY, REGARDLESS WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
      TORT OR OTHERWISE, MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE
      OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY
      BARRED. Either Party may seek preliminary relief through arbitral
      proceedings or in a court of law, and may take conservatory measures
      (e.g., attachment) if necessary.

       as may be designated by a party from time to time in accordance
       with this Section 15(a).

    b. *Authenticity of Communication*. The version of any communication
       of information as recorded by Firely shall be deemed to be
       authentic, unless Licensee provides sufficient proof as
       determined in Firely’s sole discretion that such a communication
       is inauthentic.

    c. *Severability*. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid,
       illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or before any
       arbitral tribunal, such invalidity, illegality, or
       unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision of
       this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or
       provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that
       any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or
       unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
       modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
       Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in
       order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
       originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

    d. *Assignment*. Licensee is not permitted to assign, delegate or
       otherwise transfer the any rights or obligations arising under
       this Agreement without Firely’s prior written consent. Any such
       attempted assignment, delegation or transfer will be null and

       party without giving prior notice.

       sole benefit of the Parties thereto and, except as otherwise

    f. *Waiver*. The failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, a
       right, power or remedy provided by this Agreement or any contract
       or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that right, power or
       remedy. If Firely waives a breach of any provision of this
       Agreement or any contract, this shall not operate as a waiver of
       a subsequent breach or that provision or as a waiver of a breach
       of any other provision. This Agreement may only be amended,
       modified, or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by
       each party hereto.
